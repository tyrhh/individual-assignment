        <h4>January 2022</h4>
        <h4>Work at canteen school</h4>
        <h2><b>On 15 January 2022</b>, I decided to find a job to fill in free time.I decided to work at school canteen since its near to my house. I learn many things from the other worker. When I entered into this job, I knew absolutely nothing. I was completely inexperienced and unskilled worker but after working there, it helped me to improve my working skills such as how to communicate with people around me, stay calm and focus only on my work. It also taught me to value my own work, and what I put into something.</h2>
